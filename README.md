### Dataset Information:

> CMS DATASET FILE DESCRIPTION:
>> A public use file containing information on expenditures and payment sources allowing researchers to conduct analysis on Medicare beneficiaries living only in the community. The Cost Supplement File Microdata Public Use File (PUF) dataset provides information on expenditures and payment sources for all services used by Medicare beneficiaries, including co-payments, deductibles, and non-covered services.

> Resources for Using and Understanding the Data:
>> This dataset is based on information from the MCBS and administrative data. The MCBS is a continuous, multi-purpose longitudinal survey covering a representative national sample of the Medicare population, including the population of beneficiaries aged 65 and over and beneficiaries aged 64 and below with certain disabling conditions. The MCBS collects this information in three data collection periods, or rounds, per year.

>> Disclosure protections have been applied to the file, including de-identification and other methods. As a result, the MCBS - Cost Supplement File Microdata file does not require a Data Use Agreement (DUA). In contrast, the MCBS Limited Data Set (LDS) releases contain beneficiary-level protected health information (PHI) and therefore require a DUA. The MCBS - Cost Supplement File  Microdata file is not intended to replace the more detailed LDS files but, rather, it makes available a general-use publicly-available alternative that provides the highest degree of protection to the Medicare beneficiariesâ€™ PHI.
